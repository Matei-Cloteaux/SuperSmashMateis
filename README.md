# Super Smash Mateis

## Description ðŸ˜Ž
Super Smash Mateis is a networked multiplayer remake of the Nintendo Game Super Smash Bros.â„¢ in Java. This game utilizes the java.io Socket Server library to allow players to connect each other to play together.

## History ðŸ“–
I began this project as my final project for my Junior year Computer Science class in High School, and it led me to discover how much I love Computer Science and programming. Let me tell you, I was completely obsessed with working on this game. I continued to work on this project during the Summer and into my Senior year of High School. Now, as a sophomore in College, I decided to revisit this project to make it more professional and distributable.

All of the assets for each character were taken of my friends from high school (except for Obama) and edited by myself using the greatest photo editing software ever Paint.net! The sound assets apart from the music and the gunshot sound were also created by myself using Audacity (also a wonderful program).

I really hope you have as much fun playing this game as I did creating it!

## How to Play ðŸ‘¾
As of now, I have not had the time to make this game as distributable as I wanted, so you will have to download the code and install the java JDK to be able to run it (Super Smash Mateis own private website is in development!).

Once the code is downloaded, you just have to run the Runner class in src/SSMEngines to be able to play the game. There you will be able to choose the settings for your game such as:
- Your Player Name
- The IP address that the server is hosted on (When you host the server, this section gets automatically locked as localhost)
- An option to host the server
- Player mode (single player mode forces you to host the server) 

Once all of these options have been filled out, you are ready to play the game!

## In Game Controls Controls ðŸŽ®
Once you are in Game the control scheme is as follows:
- WASD for player movement
- J for a basic attack (Usually has a low cooldown)
- K for a special attack (Longer cooldown)
- L for a charge up attack (Hold to charge up and stop pressing to release)
- P to reset dummy percentage (Only in single player mode)
